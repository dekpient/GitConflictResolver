Changes in 1.X.X
================

Features
--------

Add a new command `Keep Both` which allows you to keep both changes.

Add a new command `Swap` which allows you to keep both changes but swap the order.


Examples below.


Wording Change
--------
The intuition behind `keep ours` and `keep theirs` didn't make sense when dealing with conflicts during a rebase.
Refering from this post on Git Conflict markers: https://wincent.com/wiki/Understanding_Git_conflict_markers

`Keep Ours`  is now`Keep Head`

`Keep Theirs` is now `Keep Current`


Examples
--------
Given the following conflict.
```text
  <<<<<<< HEAD
  foo
  =======
  bar
  >>>>>>> cb1abc6bd98cfc84317f8aa95a7662815417802d
```
**Result from Keep Both**

  ```text
  foo
  bar
  ```

**Result from Swap**
  ```text
  bar
  foo
  ```

**Result from Keep Head**
  ```text
  foo
  ```

**Result from Keep Current**
```text
bar
```

Gutter marks are off by default, since they've been appreaing in unexpected places.
